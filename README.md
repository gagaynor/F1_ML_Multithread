# F1_ML_Multithread
This is for a class project, we are attempting to predict F1 Race outcomes, utilizing multithreading to optimize resource utilization on VMs.

Step 1: Develop dataset (and/or) define API sources from FastF1 library for analysis 

Step 2: Design ML decision tree model 

Step 4: Setup virtual environments for testing 

Step 5: Develop performance measurements 

Step 5: Run ML model on different environments and measure performance statistics 

Step 6: Report on outputs
